    "To speed things up a bit, we don't want to loop over sweeps on top of looping over cells. Ideally, we want to run `find_peaks` on the full recording of a cell, get the histogram, fine-tune the prominence values, and then get the spikes.Howeveranif we take a look at, in protocol `VC_clear` (see belwe can see it has was a brief interval between sweeps. This means interspike interval ISI between the last spike of one sweep and the first spike of the next won't be accurate, on top of that and we have ave missed spikes in that short period. For the other protocols this should not be an issue, and we should be able to obtain ISI from the concatenated s. Nonetheless, given that each recording has between 12 and 40 sweeps, if we discard the ISI between last spike of a sweep and first of the next we would only be \"loosing\" 12-40 ISI out of potentially hundreds. Thus, we will apply the same procedure regardless of the protocol used. eeOne strategy we can use is to create a pseudo-sweep that is concatenated to have the same length and number of sweeps as the original data, with the difference that sweep number one will be comprised of zeroes (or the number that reflects the real sweep ID), sweep number two will be comprised of ones, and so forth. Once we have obtained the indices for all the peaks we can \"deconcatenate\" them and re-assign each peak to the corresponding sweep, so that we can proceed to calculate ISI and firing rate on a sweep by sweep basis, on top of firing rate for the full recording.er on.\r\n",

    "\n",
    "Interestingly, __Step 2__ (below) shows us a very similar yet very different picture. Although the total number of peaks detected is the same, the distribution of prominence values is very different, and it seems that it is now only detecting baseline noise (0-50pA prominence) or spikes (100-175pA prominence). This is due to the fact of using a value of 10 ms as `wlen`. If we play with that value, we see small shifts in the distribution of prominences in the histogram, but as we test in __Step 4__ it doesn't seem to affect the ability to detect peaks unless we go outside the range of 2-40 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important point. According to `scipy.signal.find_peaks` documentation, `wlen` defines \"a window length in samples that optionally limits the evaluated area for each peak to a subset of x. The peak is always placed in the middle of the window therefore the given length is rounded up to the next odd integer. This parameter can speed up the calculation\". \n",
    "\n",
    " * The function works by extending \"a horizontal line from the current peak to the left and right until the line either reaches the window border (see `wlen`) or intersects the signal again at the slope of a higher peak. An intersection with a peak of the same height is ignored. On each side it finds the minimal signal value within the interval defined above. These points are the peak’s bases. The higher one of the two bases marks the peak’s lowest contour line. The prominence is then calculated as the vertical difference between the peaks height itself and its lowest contour line.\"\n",
    "\n",
    " * Importantly, they point out that \"searching for the peak’s bases can be slow for large x with periodic behavior because large chunks or even the full signal need to be evaluated for the first algorithmic step. This evaluation area can be limited with the parameter wlen which restricts the algorithm to a window around the current peak and can shorten the calculation time if the window length is short in relation to x. However, this may stop the algorithm from finding the true global contour line if the peak’s true bases are outside this window. Instead, a higher contour line is found within the restricted window leading to a smaller calculated prominence. In practice, this is only relevant for the highest set of peaks in x. This behavior may even be used intentionally to calculate “local” prominences.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, setting `wlen` to the equivalent in samples of 10ms allows us to detect \"local\" prominences. This is exactly what we want, as a spike will be a very brief peak, and we are not really interested in finding the true global countour. \n",
    "\n",
    "In __Step 4__ after fine-tuning the prominence value, we can play with the values of `wlen`. What we see is that if we set it to anything between 2 and 40 ms, the algorithm is able to find all the spikes. However, if we go higher than that, we start missing the ones happening during the test pulse. Thus, anything between 2-40 ms as `wlen` seems to do the trick, and we think that a 10 ms time window is enough, as we rarely observe anything faster than 200 Hz in our recorded activity."
